# Welcome to Ergo Development

Hello, hello. Welcome to development on the Ergo blockchain. Ergo is a fully decentralized blockchain that is utilizing the tested and proven POW (proof of work) mechanism. It's also the first eUTxO blockchain with POW. Pretty cool.

Not only that, it is supremely easy to write smart contracts on Ergo. Making developing blockchain technologies fun and easy. Though we have a lot more space to work on in terms of the development tools department. With what we have currently, it's still easy. And it will only get better as more development tools get built on the ecosystem.
